            <ol>
                <li><b>Unique Visitor Counting: </b> The system counts unique visitors by hashing a combination of the IP address, User-Agent string, and a daily-changing salt. This ensures each visitor’s identifier is unique and secure for that day.</li>
                <li><b>Privacy Enhancement: </b> Through this process, WP Statistics supports privacy compliance by anonymizing visitor data, thus aligning with stringent privacy regulations.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><b>Recommendations:</b></p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Maintain Enabled Status: </b> Keeping this feature enabled is recommended to uphold the highest standards of user privacy and security. This default setting ensures that all IP addresses are hashed from the start, offering a robust privacy-first approach.</li>
                <li><b>Retroactive Hashing: </b> For users seeking to enhance privacy for previously stored data, WP Statistics offers guidance on converting existing IP addresses to hashes, further strengthening privacy measures.</li>

            <p><b>Implications:</b></p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Reduced Privacy:</b> Disabling hashing reduces the level of privacy protection for user data, as IP addresses can be stored in a form that may be traceable to individuals.</li>

            <p><b>Recommendations:</b></p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Consider Re-Enabling:</b> To enhance user privacy and ensure compliance with privacy laws, it is advisable to re-enable the “Hash IP Addresses” feature.</li>
                <li><b>Disclosure:</b> If there are specific reasons for keeping hashing disabled, ensure transparent communication with your users by clearly disclosing this in your privacy policy, including the implications for their data privacy.</li>
