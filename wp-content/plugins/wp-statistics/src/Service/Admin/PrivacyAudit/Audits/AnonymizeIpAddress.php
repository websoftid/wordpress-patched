            <ol>
                <li><b>IPv4 Anonymization:</b> An IP address like 192.168.1.123 is transformed into 192.168.1.0.</li>
                <li><b>IPv6 Anonymization:</b> An IPv6 address like 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334 becomes 2001:0db8:85a3::.</li>
                <li><b>Enhanced Privacy:</b> After anonymization, a hashing process is applied to the IP address, further securing user data and making re-identification through IP addresses highly unlikely.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><b>Best Practices:</b></p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Privacy-First Approach:</b> Keeping this feature enabled is strongly recommended as it aligns with best data protection practices and compliance with various privacy laws and regulations.</li>
                <li><b>Transparency:</b> Ensure your privacy policy reflects this practice, enhancing trust with your site visitors.</li>

            <ol>
                <li><b>Enable Anonymization:</b> We recommend enabling the “Anonymize IP Addresses” feature to enhance user privacy and align with privacy laws and best practices.</li>
                <li><b>Review Privacy Practices:</b> If you have specific reasons for keeping this feature disabled, ensure you have adequate measures in place to protect user data and comply with applicable laws. This might include obtaining explicit consent from users for processing their complete IP addresses.</li>
